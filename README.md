# Practicals-repo
This repo will be used to practice my knowledge in everything  I learn for Frontend development.

## Objectives 
The objective of this repo is to demonstrate daily or weekly challenges I achieve as I self-study to be skill oriented in Frontend development. Results will be uploaded here and hopefully, experts and peers can help me in  collaborating  and  debugging errors in my work.
